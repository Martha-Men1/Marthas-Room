            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p>
                Hey I'm Martha, I attend the University of Waterloo as a Computer Science major. In my off time I like to DJ for my 
                friends and practice playing the guitar. I have interests in activism in tech such as learning to improve facial recognition LLM's to 
                better be accessable for Black and POC individuals.

                <br>
                The lack of diversity in the dataset perpetuates and amplifies societal biases in machine learning models (MLMs), leading to association biases, a phenomenon where models incorrectly link certain features with specific groups. 
                This issue is particularly pronounced in facial recognition models (FRMs), due to inadequate representation of diverse phenotypes results in discriminatory outcomes. A goal of mine is to close this gap and promote equality in tech.

        <h2>2025: The Women's Center Co-Internal Director (5 Months) </h2>
        <p> 
            As an Internal Director, I was responsible for managing and supporting a team of 50+ peer support volunteers in both online and in-person settings. This role required strong organization, leadership, and communication skills to ensure consistent, accessible mental health and wellness support across the community.
            This role strengthened my skills in team coordination, conflict resolution, and administrative operations. Managing over 50 volunteers taught me how to lead with empathy while maintaining structure, ensuring that both the volunteers and the individuals seeking support received the care and organization they needed.
